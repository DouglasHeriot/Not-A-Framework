
NOT A FRAMEWORK
By Douglas Heriot


ABOUT

Need to build a simple website? You’d like to use some sort of template thing, but don’t want to deal with a big framework, making the project too complicated. (and don't like Dreamweaver)

Not A Framework is basically just a bit of code to get you started — not a framework.

• Couldn't be simpler to customize 
• …umm. Are there any other features?
