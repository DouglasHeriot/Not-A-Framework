
# NOT A FRAMEWORK
By Douglas Heriot


## ABOUT

Need to build a simple website? You’d like to use some sort of template thing, but don’t want to deal with a big framework, making the project too complicated.

Not A Framework is basically just a bit of code to get you started — not a framework.




## FEATURES
* Easy pretty URLs (without .php or anything)
* Couldn't be simpler to customize 
* …umm. Are there any other features?




## CREDITS

* .htaccess file based on Simple PHP Framework
