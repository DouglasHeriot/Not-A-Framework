
# NOT A FRAMEWORK
By Douglas Heriot






## ABOUT

Need to build a simple website? You’d like to use some sort of template thing, but don’t want to deal with a big framework, making the project more complicated than it needs to be.

Not A Framework is basically just a bit of code to get you started — not a framework.




## FEATURES
* Easy pretty URLs (without .php or anything)
* Couldn’t be simpler to customize
* …umm. Are there any other features?

## Q & A

### Why  isn't this called an FAQ?

Well, nobody’s even actually asked these questions, so it doesn’t really work


### Couldn’t you have made it with less code?

Probably, but I like it how it is — it’s simple. Even if it has a little more
